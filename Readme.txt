As you probably know, Windows 10 is ‘all about updates,’ and updates are one very important part of this operating system.

Actually, updates are more important in Windows 10, than they were in any previous version of Windows.

But, a lot of users are facing various problems with Windows Update, which prevent them from receiving the latest features and improvements from Microsoft.

There are a lot of workarounds for Windows Update problems, even we showed you a few, but all these workarounds require your effort, and none of them doesn’t get the job done by itself.

Well Microsoft knows that problems with Windows update are frequent, so its engineers showed us a simple script which solves a lot of problems with Windows Update.

This is a simple batch script which resets all Windows Update components, like SoftwareDistribution folder, BTS service, Cryptographic Services, etc.

All you need to do is to run the script and everything will be automatically reset. It even works on older versions of Windows, so its use is not limited to Windows 10.
